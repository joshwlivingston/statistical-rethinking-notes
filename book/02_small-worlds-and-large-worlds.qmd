# Chapter 2: Small Worlds and Large Worlds

Statistical modeling exists dualistically, in a *small world* (contained by the
model's inherent logic) and a *big world* (the context in which the model will
live).

In the small world, it is important to make sure the model is valid,
consistent, and well-behaved.

The large world is the broader context in which the finalized model will exist. 
It is important to note that the statistical model *always* underrepresents the
full context of the large world. Out of sample data emerge, and a model's
logical inconsistencies can surface.

Adapting to the large world is a straightforward process, for nature.
For Bayesian models, the process is much more complex. It is difficult to beat
natural heuristics once a model identifies what to look for.

Chapter 2 focuses on the small world.
