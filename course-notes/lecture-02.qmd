## Globe Tossing DAG

The globe tossing example from chapter two presents an interesting example of
causal influence.

```{r}
#| message: FALSE
library(ggdag)
dag <-
  dagify(
    W ~ N + p,
    L ~ N + p,
    coords = time_ordered_coords()
  )

ggdag(dag) + theme_dag()
```

Here, `N` represents the number of times a globe is tossed, with `W` being the
number of times the globe is caught with your finger on water, and `L` being
the catches on land. `p` represents the proportion of the earth's surface
covered by water.

The DAG says the "the proportion of the earth covered by water and the number
of tosses influence the both number of water catches and the number of land
catches," an obvious and profound result.
